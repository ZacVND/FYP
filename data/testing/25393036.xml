<title>Phacoemulsification Versus Combined Phacoemulsification and Viscogonioplasty in Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</title>
<abstract>
<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the effect of <a1>phacoemulsification</a1> (Phaco) versus combined <a2>phacoemulsification</a2> and viscogonioplasty (Phaco-VGP) on long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">In this prospective randomized clinical trial, 92 eyes of 82 <p>patients</p> with PACG and coexisting cataract were randomized to undergo Phaco alone (46 eyes) or Phaco-VGP (45 eyes) and completed the trial. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography was performed preoperatively and at 1 year after surgery. Main outcome measures were <oc>IOP</oc> and the number of IOP-lowering medications.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Phaco alone reduced the mean IOP from a preoperative level of 22.3±6.3 to <r1>14.0±3.7 mm Hg</r1> at 12 months after surgery (P&amp;lt;0.001). Phaco-VGP reduced the mean IOP from a preoperative level of 23.3±7.3 to <r2>14.5±2.5 mm Hg</r2> (P&amp;lt;0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in IOP and number of medications at all follow-up times. Trabecular-iris space-area measured by anterior segment optical coherence tomography increased significantly after Phaco alone and Phaco-VGP. The amount of the increase was higher in the Phaco-VGP. Although peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) extent decreased significantly by Phaco alone, Phaco-VGP resulted in significantly greater reduction in PAS extent (P=0.004). The only variables that predicted change in IOP in the whole group were preoperative IOP (β=-0.891, P&amp;lt;0.001) and female sex (β=2.754, P=0.02).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Phaco alone and Phaco-VGP resulted in widening of the drainage angle, reduction of IOP, and PAS extent in PACG eyes. Phaco-VGP resulted in significantly more reduction of PAS and more opening of angle. However, it seems that additional VGP has no significant effect on long-term IOP.</abstracttext>
