   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the efficacy and safety of topical
    <a1>
     bimatoprost
    </a1>
    (LUMIGAN; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA) once daily with that of topical combined
    <a2>
     timolol
    </a2>
    and dorzolamide (Cosopt; Merck and Co, Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ) twice daily.

   <abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Prospective, randomized, double masked, multicenter clinical trial.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    One hundred seventy seven
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with a diagnosis of glaucoma or ocular hypertension and inadequate control of intraocular pressure after at least _POFT_ of topical timolol maleate 0.5% monotherapy.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Patients were randomized to receive bimatoprost 0.03% once daily (_POP_) or combined timolol 0.5% and dorzolamide 2% twice daily (_POP_) over a _POFT_ period.

   <abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Intraocular
    <oc>
     pressure
    </oc>
    , the primary end point, was measured at 8 Alginate Once Daily and 10 Alginate Once Daily at baseline, _POFT_, and _POFT_, _POFT_, and _POFT_, and also at _TIME_ and _TIME_ at baseline and _POFT_.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Bimatoprost provided significantly greater Intraocular Pressure lowering compared with combined timolol and dorzolamide. At the 8 Alginate Once Daily measurements, bimatoprost lowered mean Intraocular Pressure
    <r1>
     6.8 mmHg to 7.6 mmHg
    </r1>
    from baseline, whereas combined timolol and dorzolamide lowered mean Intraocular Pressure
    <r2>
     4.4 to 5.0 mmHg
    </r2>
    from baseline _PVAL_. At the last follow up, patients had better diurnal Intraocular Pressure control with bimatoprost than combined timolol and dorzolamide. At 8 Alginate Once Daily at the _POFT_ visit, the percentages of patients achieving Intraocular Pressures of _CRI_, _CRI_, _CRI_, or _CRI_ were more than twice as high for bimatoprost than for combined timolol and dorzolamide (all _PVAL_). Taste perversion, ocular burning, and stinging with instillation were more common with combined timolol and dorzolamide, whereas conjunctival hyperemia was more common with bimatoprost.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    In individuals with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled on a topical beta blocker alone, bimatoprost lowered Intraocular Pressure more consistently than did combined timolol and dorzolamide.
