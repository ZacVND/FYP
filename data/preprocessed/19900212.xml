   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the effect of time on therapy, efficacy, tolerability and resource utilization of
    <a1>
     latanoprost
    </a1>
    or non prostaglandin
    <a2>
     analogues
    </a2>
    (non Pigmentary Glaucomas) in patients who required a change in intraocular pressure lowering monotherapy.

    This open label, multicentre study (Sweden, 19 sites; Finland, seven sites) included
    <p>
     adults
    </p>
    with glaucoma or ocular hypertension with mean diurnal Intraocular Pressure _CRI_ on ocular hypotensive monotherapy. Patients were randomized to latanoprost monotherapy or non Pigmentary Glaucoma therapy (commercially available therapy other than a Pigmentary Glaucoma) and followed for _POFT_. End points included: time to treatment
    <oc>
     failure
    </oc>
    (baseline to visit with a change in/addition to treatment); diurnal Intraocular Pressure (mean of 08.00, 12.00 and _TIME_ hr measurements) at _POFT_, _POFT_, _POFT_ and 36; tolerability; and resource utilization, where analyses used Swedish and Finnish _YEAR_ unit costs.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Three hundred and twenty six patients received _CRI_dose of latanoprost (_POP_) or non Pigmentary Glaucomas (_POP_). Median time to treatment failure was longer for latanoprost (
    <r1>
     36
    </r1>
    months) than for non Pigmentary Glaucomas (
    <r2>
     12
    </r2>
    months; _PVAL_); 51% and 24% of patients remained on randomized therapy after _POFT_, respectively _PVAL_. Decreases in mean diurnal Intraocular Pressure from baseline were significantly greater for latanoprost than for non Pigmentary Glaucomas at _POFT_ and _POFT_ _PVAL_. No serious adverse events were judged to be treatment related. Mean total _POFT_ direct costs were similar in patients initiated with latanoprost and non Pigmentary Glaucomas.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Patients who failed previous monotherapy remained on therapy longer when switched to latanoprost. Latanoprost's Intraocular Pressure reducing effect and tolerability were sustained over the long term. Resource utilization and costs were generally similar in those initiating latanoprost or non Pigmentary Glaucoma therapy.
