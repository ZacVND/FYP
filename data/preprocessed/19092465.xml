    To compare the efficacy and tolerability of the fixed
    <a1>
     combination
    </a1>
    of timolol maleate 0.5%/brimonidine tartrate 0.2% versus fixed

    of timolol maleate 0.5%/dorzolamide 2% in patients with elevated intraocular pressure  over 8 weeks.

   <abstracttext label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    This 8-week, multicentric, interventional, randomized, open-label, parallel group study was conducted at 4 centers in Brazil and 1 center in Argentina.
    <p>
     Patients
    </p>
    with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive bilaterally fixed combination of brimonidine/timolol maleate 0.5% or fixed combination of dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% twice daily at 8:00 Alginate Once Daily and 8:00 PM. A modified diurnal tension curve (8:00 Alginate Once Daily, 10:30 Alginate Once Daily, 02:00 PM, and 4:00 PM) followed by the water drinking test , which estimates Intraocular Pressure peak of diurnal tension curve, were performed in the baseline and week-8 visits. Adverse events data were recorded at each visit.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    A total of 210 patients were randomized (brimonidine/timolol, n=111; dorzolamide/timolol, n=99). Mean baseline Intraocular Pressure was 23.43 +/- 3.22 mmHg and 23.43 +/- 4.06 mmHg in the patients treated with brimonidine/timolol and dorzolamide/timolol, respectively (P=0.993). Mean diurnal Intraocular Pressure

    and
    <r2>
     6.91 +/- 3.67 mmHg
    </r2>
    , respectively (P=0.811). The adjusted difference between groups (analysis of covariance) at week 8 was not statistically significant (P=0.847). Mean baseline Water Drinking Test peak was 27.79 +/- 4.29 mmHg in the brimonidine/timolol group and 27.68 +/- 5.46 mmHg in the dorzolamide/timolol group. After 8 weeks of treatment, mean Water Drinking Test peaks were 20.94 +/- 3.76 mmHg (P&lt;0.001) and 20.98 +/- 4.19 (P&lt;0.001), respectively. The adjusted difference between groups (analysis of covariance) was not statistically significant (P=0.469). No statistical difference in terms of adverse events was found between groups.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Both fixed combinations were capable of significantly reducing the mean diurnal Intraocular Pressure, mean diurnal peak, and mean Water Drinking Test peak after 8 weeks of treatment. Also, both fixed combinations are well tolerated with few side effects.
