    with primary open angle glaucoma were randomized to receive either Bimatoprost/Timolol or TTFC. Intraocular Pressures were measured at baseline, _POFT_, and _POFT_, _POFT_, 4, and _POFT_. The primary outcome measure was the mean

    in Intraocular Pressure from baseline at each visit. Secondary outcome measures included the incidence of adverse events.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Eighty patients (80 eyes) were included finally: 40 eyes in each group. Baseline mean Intraocular Pressures were 24.78 +/ 3.53 and 25.26 +/ 3.51 mmHg for Bimatoprost/Timolol and TTFC, respectively _PVAL_. Both drops provided statistically significant Intraocular Pressure reductions from baseline at all visits _PVAL_. Bimatoprost/Timolol provided greater significant mean Intraocular Pressure reductions from baseline than TTFC at each visit _PVAL_. Mean Intraocular Pressure reductions were

     11.34
    </r1>
    and
    <r2>
     6.42 mmHg
    </r2>
    at _POFT_ _PVAL_, and 11.17 and 7.89 mmHg at _POFT_ _PVAL_ for Bimatoprost/Timolol and TTFC, respectively. Intraocular Pressures at _POFT_ were ≤18 mmHg in 36 _MEAS_ versus 22 _MEAS_ eyes and ≤16 mmHg in 28 _MEAS_ versus 16 _MEAS_ eyes _PVAL_, and at _POFT_, ≤18 mmHg in 38 _MEAS_ versus 28 _MEAS_ eyes and ≤16 mmHg in 30 _MEAS_ versus 18 _MEAS_ eyes for Bimatoprost/Timolol and TTFC, respectively _PVAL_.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Both drops provided effective Intraocular Pressure reduction that was greater and patients were more likely to achieve lower target pressures with Bimatoprost/Timolol than with TTFC.
