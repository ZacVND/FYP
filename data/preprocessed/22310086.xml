    To compare the efficacy and safety of

    , a preservative-free  prostaglandin analogue, with Preservative-Free
    <a2>

     patients

    with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

   <abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial.

   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    After discontinuation and washout of existing ocular hypotensive treatment, patients who had intraocular pressure  =23 and =36 mmHg in at least 1 eye at the 08:00 hour time point were randomized 1:1 to 12 weeks of treatment with either Preservative-Free tafluprost 0.0015% or Preservative-Free timolol 0.5%.

     Intraocular Pressure

    was measured 3 times during the day (08:00, 10:00, 16:00 hours) at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, and 12. It was hypothesized that Preservative-Free tafluprost would be noninferior to Preservative-Free timolol over 12 weeks with regard to change from baseline Intraocular Pressure. The trial was powered for a noninferiority margin of 1.5 mmHg at each of the 9 time points assessed.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    A total of 643 patients were randomized and 618 completed (Preservative-Free tafluprost = 306, Preservative-Free timolol = 312). Intraocular Pressures at the 3 time points assessed during the baseline visit ranged from 23.8 to 26.1 mmHg in the Preservative-Free tafluprost group and 23.5 to 26.0 mmHg in the Preservative-Free timolol group. Intraocular Pressures at the 3 time points assessed during the 12-week visit ranged from
    <r1>
     17.4 to 18.6 mmHg
    </r1>
    for Preservative-Free tafluprost and
    <r2>
     17.9 to 18.5 mmHg
    </r2>
    for Preservative-Free timolol. At all 9 time points, the upper limits of the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for the difference between treatments in Intraocular Pressure lowering were less than the prespecified noninferiority margin. Similar percentages of Preservative-Free tafluprost and Preservative-Free timolol patients reported ocular pain/stinging/irritation (4.4% versus 4.6%) and pruritus (2.5% versus 1.5%). The percentages of Preservative-Free tafluprost and Preservative-Free timolol patients reporting conjunctival hyperemia were 4.4% versus 1.2% (nominal P = .016).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    The Intraocular Pressure-lowering effect of Preservative-Free tafluprost was noninferior to that of Preservative-Free timolol. Preservative-Free tafluprost is an efficacious and generally well-tolerated ocular hypotensive agent.
