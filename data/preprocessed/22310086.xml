   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the efficacy and safety of
    <a1>
     tafluprost
    </a1>
    , a preservative free prostaglandin analogue, with Preservative Free
    <a2>
     timolol
    </a2>
    in
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

   <abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Randomized, double masked, multicenter clinical trial.

   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    After discontinuation and washout of existing ocular hypotensive treatment, patients who had intraocular pressure _CRI_and _CRI_ in at least 1 eye at the 08:_POFT_ time point were randomized _RATIO_ to _POFT_ of treatment with either Preservative Free tafluprost 0.0015% or Preservative Free timolol 0.5%.

     Intraocular Pressure
    </oc>
    was measured 3 times during the day (_TIME_, _TIME_, 16:_POFT_) at baseline and at _POFT_, _POFT_, and _POFT_. It was hypothesized that Preservative Free tafluprost would be noninferior to Preservative Free timolol over _POFT_ with regard to change from baseline Intraocular Pressure. The trial was powered for a noninferiority margin of 1.5 mmHg at each of the 9 time points assessed.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    A total of 643 patients were randomized and 618 completed (Preservative Free tafluprost _CRI_, Preservative Free timolol _CRI_). Intraocular Pressures at the 3 time points assessed during the baseline visit ranged from 23.8 to 26.1 mmHg in the Preservative Free tafluprost group and 23.5 to 26.0 mmHg in the Preservative Free timolol group. Intraocular Pressures at the 3 time points assessed during the _POFT_ visit ranged from
    <r1>
     17.4 to 18.6 mmHg
    </r1>
    for Preservative Free tafluprost and
    <r2>
     17.9 to 18.5 mmHg
    </r2>
    for Preservative Free timolol. At all 9 time points, the upper limits of the 2 sided 95% confidence intervals for the difference between treatments in Intraocular Pressure lowering were less than the prespecified noninferiority margin. Similar percentages of Preservative Free tafluprost and Preservative Free timolol patients reported ocular pain/stinging/irritation (4.4% versus 4.6%) and pruritus (2.5% versus 1.5%). The percentages of Preservative Free tafluprost and Preservative Free timolol patients reporting conjunctival hyperemia were 4.4% versus 1.2% (nominal _PVAL_).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    The Intraocular Pressure lowering effect of Preservative Free tafluprost was noninferior to that of Preservative Free timolol. Preservative Free tafluprost is an efficacious and generally well tolerated ocular hypotensive agent.
