    In a prospective, _POFT_, investigator masked, parallel group study conducted at numerous centers in the United States, 165 previously treated patients with Intraocular Pressure _CRI_ in one or both eyes after washout were randomly assigned to receive either latanoprost 0.005% once daily in the evening or unoprostone 0.15% twice daily. Observations procedures were Goldmann applanation tonometry, best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy. The main outcome measure was

    in the mean of the Intraocular Pressures measured at _TIME_ Alginate Once Daily, 12 _TIME_, and _TIME_ between baseline (before treatment) and after _POFT_ of treatment.

    The change in the mean +/ Surgery , Mean of the Intraocular Pressures measured at _TIME_ Alginate Once Daily, 12 _TIME_, and _TIME_ was
    <r1>
     7.2 +/ 3.2 mmHg

    _MEAS_ for latanoprost (25.3 +/ 2.8 mmHg at baseline to 18.2 +/ 2.8 mmHg at _POFT_) and

    _MEAS_ for unoprostone (25.5 +/ 3.3 mmHg at baseline to 21.6 +/ 4.0 mmHg; _PVAL_. No serious adverse event related to either medication was reported.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Over an _POFT_ period, latanoprost 0.005% once daily lowered Intraocular Pressure more than unoprostone 0.15% twice daily in patients with elevated Intraocular Pressure. Both agents were safe and well tolerated.
