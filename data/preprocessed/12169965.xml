    To assess the intraocular pressure lowering efficacy and the postoperative complication profile of
    <a1>

    </a1>
    versus

     trabeculectomy

   <abstracttext label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Sixty eyes of 60
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with medically uncontrolled open angle glaucoma were randomized either to the viscocanalostomy or to the trabeculectomy group of the trial. Viscocanalostomy was performed according to Stegmann's technique using high molecular weight sodium hyaluronate to fill the ostia of the Schlemm canal. For trabeculectomy, a modified Cairns trabeculectomy was performed. Examinations were performed before surgery and postoperatively daily for _POFT_. Follow up visits were scheduled 1, 6, and _POFT_ after surgery.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    The mean preoperative intraocular pressure was 27.1 (7.1) mmHg for all patients enrolled. One day after surgery, mean intraocular pressure was 15.9 (5.2) for the trabeculectomy group _PVAL_ and 15.7 (3.6) for the viscocanalostomy group _PVAL_, respectively. The success rate, defined as an intraocular
    <oc>
     pressure
    </oc>
    lower than 22 mmHg without medication, was
    <r2>
     56.7%
    </r2>
    in the trabeculectomy group and
    <r1>
     30%
    </r1>
    in the viscocanalostomy group at _POFT_ postoperatively _PVAL_. The number of postoperative complications was lower in the viscocanalostomy group than in the trabeculectomy group.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    In eyes with open angle glaucoma, viscocanalostomy is less effective in reducing intraocular pressure than standard filtering surgery. However, postoperative complications are more frequent after filtering surgery.
