    To compare the efficacy and tolerability of

     latanoprost
    </a1>
    or
    <a2>
     brimonidine
    </a2>
    in

     patients
    </p>
    with elevated intraocular pressure .

   <abstracttext label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    This prospective, randomized, masked-evaluator, parallel-group, multicenter study in the United States included patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Patients received latanoprost 0.005% once daily (8:00 Alginate Once Daily; n = 152) or brimonidine tartrate 0.2% twice daily (8:00 Alginate Once Daily and 8:00 PM; n = 151). Patients underwent evaluation at screening, baseline (randomization), and after 0.5, 3, and 6 months of treatment. Intraocular Pressure was measured at 8:00 Alginate Once Daily, 10:00 Alginate Once Daily, noon, and 4:00 PM at baseline and the months 3 and 6 visits, and at 8:00 Alginate Once Daily only at week 2. The main outcome measure was the difference in diurnal Intraocular Pressure

    from baseline to month 6 between treatment groups. Adverse events were recorded at each visit.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Baseline mean diurnal Intraocular Pressure levels were similar between groups. At month 6, the adjusted mean ( +/- Standard Error Of MeanM) diurnal Intraocular Pressure reduction was
    <r1>
     5.7 +/- 0.3 mmHg
    </r1>
    in the latanoprost group and
    <r2>
     3.1 +/- 0.3 mmHg
    </r2>
    in patients receiving brimonidine (P &lt; 0.001). The mean difference in diurnal Intraocular Pressure reduction was 2.5 +/- 0.3 mmHg (95% Confidence Interval: 1.9, 3.2; P &lt; 0.001). Five times more patients receiving brimonidine than latanoprost were withdrawn from the study due to adverse events.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Latanoprost instilled once daily is more effective and better tolerated than brimonidine administered twice daily for the treatment of patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. During therapy, the range of daily fluctuation of Intraocular Pressure is less for latanoprost compared with brimonidine.
