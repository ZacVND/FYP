    Many physicians recommend either

     brimonidine
    </a1>
    or
    <a2>
     latanoprost
    </a2>
    as firstline therapy for chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. However, a search of MEDLINE indicates that there have been few head to head comparisons of the 2 monotherapies in a clinical setting.

    This study compared the clinical efficacy and tolerability of brimonidine 0.2% twice daily with those of latanoprost 0.005% once daily as monotherapy in

   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    In this _POFT_, multicenter, double masked, parallel group, 4 visit study, treatment naive and previously treated patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and bilateral intraocular pressure after washout of between 22 and 34 mmHg were randomized to receive either brimonidine or latanoprost. Patients who had received previous treatment with either study drug were excluded from the study. The primary outcome measure was response rate, defined as the percentage of patients achieving _CRI_
    <oc>
     reduction
    </oc>
    in Intraocular Pressure from baseline to _POFT_. Secondary outcome measures were mean Intraocular Pressure reduction from baseline to _POFT_ and clinical success, defined as the investigator's recommendation that the patient continue using the assigned study medication.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    A total of 127 patients (55 treatment naive) were enrolled, 66 in the brimonidine group and 61 in the latanoprost group. After _POFT_ of treatment,
    <r1>
     80%
    </r1>
    of patients in the brimonidine group and
    <r2>
     74%
    </r2>
    of patients in the latanoprost group had achieved _CRI_ reduction in Intraocular Pressure from baseline. The mean reduction in Intraocular Pressure from baseline at _POFT_ was 6.8 mmHg with brimonidine and 6.5 mmHg with latanoprost (27.8% versus 27.0%, respectively). Among treatment naive patients, a significantly higher percentage of brimonidine treated patients achieved _CRI_ decrease in Intraocular Pressure compared with latanoprost treated patients (88% versus 59%, respectively; _PVAL_). In previously treated patients, a higher percentage of the latanoprost group achieved _CRI_ reduction in Intraocular Pressure compared with the brimonidine group (88% versus 74%, respectively); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Significantly more patients in the brimonidine group achieved clinical success at _POFT_ compared with patients in the latanoprost group (91% versus 74%; _PVAL_).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    At peak effect, brimonidine twice daily was as effective as latanoprost once daily in lowering Intraocular Pressure. In treatment naive patients, latanoprost was associated with a significantly higher rate of nonresponse after _POFT_ of treatment compared with brimonidine. This suggests that brimonidine may be the more reliable choice for first line therapy of newly diagnosed open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In previously treated patients, however, latanoprost provided greater mean Intraocular Pressure reduction than did brimonidine. Significantly more patients achieved clinical success with brimonidine monotherapy than with latanoprost monotherapy.
