   <abstracttext label="BACKGROUND" nlmcategory="BACKGROUND">
    Increased intraocular pressure has been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for developing glaucoma. Yet it has not been clearly demonstrated that Intraocular Pressure lowering treatment can reduce the incidence of glaucoma damage in patients with ocular hypertension. The aim of the current paper was to report the results of a long term study addressing this very problem.

    We conducted a randomised, double masked study comparing
    <a1>
     timolol
    </a1>
    and
    <a2>
     placebo
    </a2>
    treatment in 90
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with ocular hypertension plus some additional risk factor. Patients were followed at _POFT_ intervals prospectively for _POFT_ or until glaucomatous field loss could be demonstrated with computerised perimetry. A post study analysis was performed including all available data, thus extending maximum follow up to _POFT_.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    After _POFT_ of follow up
    <r1>
     eight
    </r1>
    patients in the placebo group and
    <r2>
     five
    </r2>
    patients in the timolol group had developed glaucomatous field
    <oc>
     loss
    </oc>
    ; the corresponding figures after _POFT_ were 15 patients in the placebo group and seven patients in the timolol group. Survival analysis showed a tendency but no statistically significant difference between treatment groups _PVAL_. Study attrition was large. Eighteen patients in each group had developed glaucomatous field loss when also post study data were included. Intraocular Pressure reduction was greater in eyes passing the _POFT_ visit without field loss _MEAS_, than in those that reached an end point _MEAS_.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    In this long term study we found a tendency but failed to prove a beneficial effect of topical timolol treatment in patients with elevated Intraocular Pressure, normal visual fields and some additional risk factor. The intent to treat analysis showed no difference between treatment groups. The high attrition shows the difficulties associated with very long follow up.
