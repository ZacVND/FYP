    was determined using pointwise linear regression analysis, defined as the same 3 or more visual field locations with a slope more negative than -1.0 dB/year at P &lt; 5%, on 3 consecutive tests. Ocular and systemic risk factors were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model and further tested for independence in a multivariate model.

    A total of 253 eyes of 127 subjects (mean age, 64.7 +/- 10.9 years; mean follow-up, 40.6 +/- 12 months) were analyzed. Eyes randomized to timolol progressed faster than those randomized to brimonidine (mean rates of progression,

    versus

    dB/y, P &lt; .01). In the final multivariate model adjusting for all tested covariates, older age (hazard ratio  = 1.41/decade older, 95% confidence interval  = 1.05 to 1.90, P = .022), use of systemic antihypertensives (Hazard Ratio = 2.53, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.32 to 4.87, P = .005), and mean ocular perfusion pressure (Hazard Ratio = 1.21/mmHg lower, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.12 to 1.31, P &lt; .001) were associated with progression whereas randomization to brimonidine revealed a protective effect (Hazard Ratio = 0.26, 95% Confidence Interval = 0.12 to 0.55, P &lt; .001).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    While randomization to brimonidine 0.2% was protective compared to timolol 0.5%, lower mean ocular perfusion pressure increased the risk for reaching a progression outcome in the Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study. This suggests that the beneficial effect of randomization to the brimonidine arm was independent of possible differences in ocular perfusion pressures between the 2 treatment arms. The current results and large number of drop-outs in the brimonidine 0.2% arm suggest that more research is necessary before altering clinical practice paradigms.
