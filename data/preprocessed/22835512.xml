    was determined using pointwise linear regression analysis, defined as the same 3 or more visual field locations with a slope more negative than 1.0 dB/year at _PVAL_, on 3 consecutive tests. Ocular and systemic risk factors were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model and further tested for independence in a multivariate model.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    A total of 253 eyes of 127 subjects (mean age, 64.7 +/ _POFT_; mean follow up, 40.6 +/ _POFT_) were analyzed. Eyes randomized to timolol progressed faster than those randomized to brimonidine (mean rates of progression,

    </r1>
    versus
    <r2>
     0.02 +/ 0.7

    dB/y, _PVAL_). In the final multivariate model adjusting for all tested covariates, older age (hazard ratio _CRI_/decade older, 95% confidence interval _CRI_to 1.90, _PVAL_), use of systemic antihypertensives (Hazard Ratio _CRI_, 95% Confidence Interval _CRI_to 4.87, _PVAL_), and mean ocular perfusion pressure (Hazard Ratio _CRI_/mmHg lower, 95% Confidence Interval _CRI_to 1.31, _PVAL_) were associated with progression whereas randomization to brimonidine revealed a protective effect (Hazard Ratio _CRI_, 95% Confidence Interval _CRI_to 0.55, _PVAL_).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    While randomization to brimonidine 0.2% was protective compared to timolol 0.5%, lower mean ocular perfusion pressure increased the risk for reaching a progression outcome in the Low pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study. This suggests that the beneficial effect of randomization to the brimonidine arm was independent of possible differences in ocular perfusion pressures between the 2 treatment arms. The current results and large number of drop outs in the brimonidine 0.2% arm suggest that more research is necessary before altering clinical practice paradigms.
