   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the longitudinal effects of treatment on intraocular pressure and visual field performance in Japanese normal tension glaucoma between
    <a1>
     latanoprost
    </a1>
    and
    <a2>
     timolol
    </a2>
    .

   <abstracttext label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    This is an open label, randomized, study. A total of 62 Normal Tension Glaucoma
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    were prospectively, consecutively enrolled. All study subjects were randomly assigned to 0.005% latanoprost instillation once daily in the morning or 0.5% timolol instillation twice daily for a prospective _POFT_ follow up, and underwent a routine ocular examination every month. Automated perimetry was performed every _POFT_ using Humphrey field analysers. Stereophotographs of optic discs were also obtained every _POFT_.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Percentage of Intraocular Pressure reduction or the magnitude of Intraocular Pressure reduction showed no intergroup differences either at any time point (13 15%). In the visual field, the estimated rate of
    <oc>
     change
    </oc>
    in the Mean Deviation value (dB/year) was
    <r1>
     0.34 +/ 0.17
    </r1>
    for the latanoprost group, and
    <r2>
     0.10 +/ 0.18
    </r2>
    for the timolol group. The estimated rate of change in Mean Deviation showed no significant difference from zero in both groups, and there were no statistical intergroup differences. No changes in the optic nerve head topography in the vertical cup to disc ratio and rim area measured by image analysis techniques were observed in either group. There were no patients who dropped out due to the side effects of treatment regimens.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Both latanoprost and timolol single treatments reduced Intraocular Pressure by 13 15% at their trough effects for _POFT_ in Japanese Normal Tension Glaucoma patients; both showed similar effects on visual field performance.
