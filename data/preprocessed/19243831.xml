    Prospective randomized clinical trial.

   <abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Recruited patients were randomized into group 1 (phacoemulsification alone) or group 2 (combined phacotrabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C). Postoperatively, patients were reviewed every 3 months for 2 years.

    Intraocular

    and requirement for topical glaucoma drugs.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Twenty-seven Chronic Angle Closure Glaucoma eyes were randomized into group 1, and 24 Chronic Angle Closure Glaucoma eyes were randomized into group 2. Combined phacotrabeculectomy resulted in lower mean postoperative Intraocular Pressure than phacoemulsification alone at 3 months (

     14.0
    </r1>
    versus
    <r2>
     17.0 mmHg
    </r2>
    , P = 0.01), 15 months (13.2 versus 15.4 mmHg, P = 0.02), and 18 months (13.6 versus 15.9 mmHg, P = 0.01). Combined phacotrabeculectomy resulted in 1.25 fewer topical glaucoma drugs (P&lt;0.001) in the 24-month postoperative period, compared with phacoemulsification alone. Combined surgery was associated with more postoperative complications (P&lt;0.001) and more progression of optic neuropathy (P = 0.03), compared with phacoemulsification alone.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Combined phacotrabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C is more effective than phacoemulsification alone in controlling Intraocular Pressure in medically uncontrolled Chronic Angle Closure Glaucoma eyes with coexisting cataract. Combined phacotrabeculectomy is associated with more postoperative complications.
