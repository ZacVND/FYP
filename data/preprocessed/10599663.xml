    To report the longer term results of a randomized, clinical trial comparing the

    Extended follow up on a randomized, controlled trial.

    Between _DATE_ and _DATE_, 107
    <p>
     patients

    with uncontrolled intraocular pressure due to non neovascular glaucoma associated with aphakia, pseudophakia, or failed filters were randomly assigned for surgical placement of either the 350 mm or the 500 mm2 Baerveldt implant at the Doheny Eye Institute.

   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    A random numbers table was used to assign each patient to one of the two groups. Preoperative Intraocular Pressures and visual acuities were recorded. Clinical records were reviewed to ascertain postoperative Intraocular Pressures, visual acuities, number of medications used, and implant related complications that occurred throughout the follow up period.

   <abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Success was defined as
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressure
    </oc>
    of 6 mmHg or greater and of 21 mmHg or less in two or more consecutive follow up visits without further glaucoma surgery or loss of light perception attributable to glaucoma.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    The overall success rates were
    <r1>
     87%
    </r1>
    for the 350 mm2 group and
    <r2>
     70%
    </r2>
    for the 500 mm2 group _PVAL_. Average follow up was _POFT_ (range, 1 _POFT_) for the 350 mm2 group and _POFT_ (range, 5 _POFT_) for the 500 mm2 group. The life table success rates declined over time for both implant groups, from a high of 98% for the 350 mm2 group and 92% for the 500 mm2 group at _POFT_ to a cumulative success rate of 79% for the 350 mm2 group and 66% for the 500 mm2 group at _POFT_. Visual acuities were better or remained the same in 50% of the patients in the 350 mm2 group and 46% of those in the 500 mm2 group. Complications during the _POFT_ follow up were also statistically similar.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    The longer term results show that the 350 mm2 Baerveldt implant is more successful than the 500 mm2 implant for overall Intraocular Pressure control. Interval comparisons indicate a higher rate of success for the 350 mm2 implant in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth years of implantation. Visual acuities, implant related complications, and average Intraocular Pressures were statistically indistinguishable between the two groups.
