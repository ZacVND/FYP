    To compare the ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of topical
    <a1>
     bimatoprost
    </a1>
    and
    <a2>
     timolol dorzolamide combination
    </a2>
    in patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension during _POFT_ of treatment.

   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    A sample of 65
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with a diagnosis of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either bimatoprost 0.03% once daily or timolol dorzolamide combination twice daily. Study visits occurred at baseline and after _POFT_ and _POFT_, _POFT_ and _POFT_ of therapy. Intraocular pressure measurements were performed at _POFT_ at all study visits and also at _POFT_ and _POFT_ at baseline and _POFT_ visits. At each visit, local and systemic side effects that occurred during the treatment period were recorded. Student's t test was used to compare the differences between Intraocular Pressure values.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Differences in Intraocular Pressure between the bimatoprost and timolol dorzolamide groups were statistically insignificant at all study visits _PVAL_. In the bimatoprost treated group, the Intraocular Pressure

     reduction
    </oc>
    was
    <r1>
     6.2 +/ 1.8 mmHg
    </r1>
    , whereas it was
    <r2>
     6.5 +/ 2.3 mmHg
    </r2>
    in the timolol dorzolamide group after _POFT_ of treatment. The difference was not statistically significant _PVAL_.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    The Intraocular Pressure lowering efficacies of bimatoprost and timolol dorzolamide combination were similar over a _POFT_ follow up. Both bimatoprost and the timolol dorzolamide combination were well tolerated. Bimatoprost can be used as a longterm monotherapy agent in the treatment of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma and ocular hypertension.
