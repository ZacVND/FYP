   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To test the hypothesis that neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser peripheral
    <a1>
     iridotomy
    </a1>
    significantly reduces the incidence of conversion from pigment dispersion syndrome with ocular hypertension to pigmentary glaucoma .

   <abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Prospective, randomized, controlled _POFT_ trial.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    One hundred sixteen eyes of 116
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with Pigment Dispersion Syndrome and Ocular Hypertension.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Patients were assigned randomly either to Nd:YAG Laser Peripheral Iridotomy or to a
    <a2>
     control
    </a2>
    group (no laser).

   <abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    The primary outcome measure was
    <oc>
     conversion
    </oc>
    to Pigmentary Glaucoma within _POFT_, based on full threshold visual field analysis using the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study criteria. Secondary outcome measures were whether eyes required topical antiglaucoma medications during the study period and the time to conversion or medication.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Fifty seven patients were randomized to undergo laser treatment and 59 were randomized to no laser (controls). Age, gender, spherical equivalent refraction, and intraocular pressure at baseline were similar between groups. Outcome data were available for 105 _MEAS_ of recruited subjects, 52 in the laser treatment group and 53 in the no laser treatment group. Patients were followed up for a median of _POFT_ (range, 10 _POFT_) in the laser arm and _POFT_ (range, 1 _POFT_) in the control arm. Eight eyes (
    <r1>
     15%
    </r1>
    ) in the laser group and 3 eyes (
    <r2>
     6%
    </r2>
    ) in the control group converted to glaucoma in the study period. The proportion of eyes started on medical treatment was similar in the 2 groups: 8 eyes _MEAS_ in the laser group and 9 eyes _MEAS_ in the control group. Survival analyses showed no evidence of any difference in time to Visual Field progression or commencement of topical therapy between the 2 groups. Cataract extraction was performed on 1 patient in the laser group and in 1 patient in the control group during the study period (laser eye at _POFT_; control eye at _POFT_).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    This study suggests that there was no benefit of Nd:YAG Laser Peripheral Iridotomy in preventing progression from Pigment Dispersion Syndrome with Ocular Hypertension to Pigmentary Glaucoma within _POFT_ of follow up.
