   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the effectiveness and safety of
    <a1>
     viscocanalostomy
    </a1>
    and
    <a2>
     trabeculectomy
    </a2>
    in adults with uncontrolled open angle glaucoma.

   <abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Single masked, parallel group, prospective, randomized _POFT_ trial, with 90% power to detect a clinically important difference between groups.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Fifty consecutive
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    (50 eyes) with primary open angle or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Eyes were assigned randomly to either viscocanalostomy (group 1) or trabeculectomy (group 2) with no intraoperative antifibrotics in the study eye. In group 1, no further intervention was allowed, whereas trabeculectomy eyes could receive subconjunctival 5 fluorouracil injections or laser suture lysis after surgery.

    Success rate based on intraocular
    <oc>
     pressure
    </oc>
    , visual acuity, discomfort, and other complications.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    At the end of the _POFT_ follow up, Intraocular Pressure of 21 mmHg or less and more than 6 mmHg was achieved in
    <r1>
     76%
    </r1>
    in group 1 (_POP_) and in
    <r2>
     80%
    </r2>
    in group 2 (_POP_; log rank _PVAL_); an Intraocular Pressure between 6 and 16 mmHg was obtained in 56% in group 1 (_POP_) and in 72% in group 2 (_POP_; log rank _PVAL_; Kaplan Meier cumulative probability of success). Complications of viscocanalostomy included one intraoperative conversion into trabeculectomy; microruptures in Descemet's membrane in five eyes; three cases of iris incarceration in the Decemet's window, two of which caused early failure of the procedure requiring reoperation; and a 1 mm to 2 mm transient self resolving hyphema in three cases. Complications of trabeculectomy included one case of postoperative bleb bleeding with early transient Intraocular Pressure spike; one early hyphema; five cases of postoperative hypotony, two of which had a positive Seidel test from the conjunctival suture; three cases of transient choroidal detachment, two of which had shallow anterior chamber. No patient required reoperation. Two eyes required argon laser suture lysis, and nine underwent one or more 5 Fluorouracil injections, which caused punctate keratopathy in three eyes.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Viscocanalostomy is an effective Intraocular Pressure lowering procedure in white adults affected by open angle glaucoma. Trabeculectomy with postoperative 5 Fluorouracil can probably provides lower Intraocular Pressures but, with more numerous complications, greater discomfort, and more intensive postoperative management.
