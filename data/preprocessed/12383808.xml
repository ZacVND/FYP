    To compare the safety and efficacy of intraoperative

    One hundred fifteen eyes of 103
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with uncontrolled intraocular pressure  despite maximally tolerated medical therapy or laser were prospectively randomized in a double-masked fashion to one of two treatment groups in a single institution setting. Subject's eyes underwent primary trabeculectomy with either topical 5-Fluorouracil (50 mg/ml for 5 minutes) or topical Mitomycin C (0.2 mg/ml for 2 minutes). Primary outcome measures included the number of eyes achieving target

     pressures

    of 21, 18, 15, and 12 mmHg at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures included Intraocular Pressure, best-corrected visual acuity, complications, and interventions.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Of the 115 eyes, 57 received 5-Fluorouracil while 58 received Mitomycin C. A target Intraocular Pressure of 21 mmHg at 6 months was achieved in 53 of 56 (
    <r1>
     95%
    </r1>
    ) eyes in the 5-Fluorouracil group and 54 of 57 (
    <r2>
     95%
    </r2>
    ) eyes in the Mitomycin C group (P = 1.00). At 12 months, 45 of 48 (94%) eyes in the 5-Fluorouracil group met a target Intraocular Pressure of 21 mmHg while 48 of 54 (89%) eyes in the Mitomycin C group did (P =.49). The most common complications in each group were persistent choroidal effusions and bleb leak.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Our study suggests that intraoperative topical 5-Fluorouracil is at least as effective as intraoperative topical Mitomycin C in reducing Intraocular Pressure of eyes undergoing primary trabeculectomy.
