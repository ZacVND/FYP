   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    In this prospective, randomized, multicenter, investigator masked, parallel group study, patients were treated with latanoprost monotherapy for at least four weeks prior to baseline. At baseline on latanoprost, patients with Intraocular Pressure 21 mmHg in at least one eye were randomized to twice daily fixed brimonidine timolol (_POP_) or timolol (_POP_), each adjunctive to latanoprost for _POFT_.

     Intraocular Pressure

    was measured at _TIME_ and _TIME_ at baseline, _POFT_, and _POFT_2 and evaluated in the per protocol population. The primary efficacy endpoint was peak Intraocular Pressure lowering at _TIME_, _POFT_2. Safety measures included adverse events.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Baseline mean Intraocular Pressure was similar at _TIME_ in the treatment groups (brimonidine timolol 23.4 mmHg; timolol 23.0 mmHg). The mean additional reduction from latanoprost treated baseline Intraocular Pressure was
    <r1>
     8.3 mmHg
    </r1>
    _MEAS_ with fixed brimonidine timolol and
    <r2>
     6.2 mmHg
    </r2>
    _MEAS_ with timolol at _TIME_, _POFT_2 _PVAL_. Patients treated with fixed brimonidine timolol adjunctive to latanoprost were significantly more likely than patients treated with adjunctive timolol to achieve an Intraocular Pressure _CRI_ _PVAL_ and a 20% reduction in Intraocular Pressure from baseline _PVAL_ at both _TIME_ and _TIME_ in _POFT_2. Adverse events occurred in 14.7% of fixed brimonidine timolol patients and 12.7% of timolol patients. Biomicroscopy findings were similar between the treatment groups after _POFT_ of treatment.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Fixed combination brimonidine timolol reduced Intraocular Pressure significantly more effectively than timolol when used as adjunctive therapy to latanoprost in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Both fixed brimonidine timolol and timolol were well tolerated as agents adjunctive to latanoprost.
