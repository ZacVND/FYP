   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Hospital files were retrospectively examined for 99 Chinese Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    ; 75 patients underwent combined surgery and 24 underwent trabeculectomy alone. Success rates were assessed with the Kaplan Meier survival analysis. The main outcome was the complete success rate defined as either a _CRI_

     reduction

    in intraocular pressure or an Intraocular Pressure that remained below 15 mmHg, with no medications required.

    Patients in the combined group and trabeculectomy group had a mean follow up period of 25.8 (Surgery , Mean 10.8) months and 31.4 (8.9) months, respectively. Survival analysis showed that the complete success rate at _POFT_ was
    <r1>
     56%
    </r1>
    in the combined group and
    <r2>
     54%
    </r2>
    in the trabeculectomy group _PVAL_. There were no significant differences between groups in either Intraocular Pressure or the number of glaucoma medications throughout the _POFT_ follow up. The incidences of postoperative complications were similar between groups _PVAL_. No additional Intraocular Pressure lowering surgical procedures were required in the combined group, while 13 _MEAS_ eyes in the trabeculectomy group required either cataract extraction or further Intraocular Pressure lowering surgical procedures _PVAL_.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    In patients with Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma, the long term Intraocular Pressure lowering effect and surgical complications of combined trabeculectomy and cataract extraction are comparable with those of trabeculectomy alone. However, the combined surgery incurred fewer subsequent surgical interventions.
