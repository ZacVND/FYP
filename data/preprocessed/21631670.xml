    To determine the effect of scleral flap size on the medium term intraocular pressure control and complication rates after augmented trabeculectomy.

   <abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Prospective randomized clinical trial.

    undergoing primary trabeculectomy. Exclusion criteria included previous ocular surgery apart from cataract surgery, secondary glaucoma and age under 18.

    Patients were randomized to either standard
    <a1>
     trabeculectomy
    </a1>
    (4 × 4 mm scleral flap) or
    <a2>
     microtrabeculectomy
    </a2>
    (2 × 2 mm scleral flap), both with adjustable sutures and antimetabolites. Bleb needling was performed as required. Patients were evaluated at day 1, _POFT_, _POFT_, _POFT_ and _POFT_, _POFT_, _POFT_, 18 and 24 postoperatively.

    , complications and failure (intraocular pressure ≥ 21 mmHg or not reduced by ≥20% from baseline, intraocular pressure ≤ 5 mmHg, repeat glaucoma surgery and no light perception vision).
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Forty one patients were recruited; 20 had standard trabeculectomy, and 21 had microtrabeculectomy. At _POFT_, the mean intraocular pressure and cumulative probability of failure was
    <r1>
     12.4 +/ 4.6 mmHg
    </r1>
    and 0.28 for standard trabeculectomy, and
    <r2>
     11.5 +/ 3.6 mmHg
    </r2>
    and 0.27 for microtrabeculectomy (_PVAL_ and 0.89, respectively). One patient in each group required Baerveldt device implantation. Vision reduced ≥2 Snellen lines in 15% in the standard trabeculectomy group and 25% in the microtrabeculectomy group, mainly from cataract _PVAL_.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Both trabeculectomy techniques achieved good intraocular pressure reduction and had similar complication rates. Scleral flap size had no significant effect on medium term intraocular pressure control and complication profile.
