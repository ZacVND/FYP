    Exclusion criteria included untreated intraocular pressure _CRI_, visual field mean deviation worse than _DATE_ibels, or contraindications to study medications. Both eyes received twice daily monotherapy randomized in blocks of 7 (4 brimonidine to 3 timolol). Standard automated perimetry and tonometry were performed at _POFT_ intervals. Main outcome measure was field

    in either eye, defined as the same 3 or more points with a negative slope 1 dB/year at _PVAL_, on 3 consecutive tests, assessed by pointwise linear regression. Secondary outcome measures were progression based on glaucoma change probability maps of pattern deviation and the 3 omitting method for pointwise linear regression.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Ninety nine patients were randomized to brimonidine and 79 to timolol. Mean ( +/ Standard Error Of Mean) months of follow up for all patients was 30.0 +/ 2. Statistically fewer brimonidine treated patients (9,

    ) had visual field progression by pointwise linear regression than timolol treated patients (31,

     39.2%
    </r2>
    , log rank 12.4, _PVAL_). Mean treated Intraocular Pressure was similar for brimonidine and timolol treated patients at all time points. More brimonidine treated (28, 28.3%) than timolol treated (9, 11.4%) patients discontinued study participation because of drug related adverse events _PVAL_. Similar differences in progression were observed when analyzed by Glaucoma Change Probability Maps and the 3 omitting method.

    Low pressure glaucoma patients treated with brimonidine 0.2% who do not develop ocular allergy are less likely to have field progression than patients treated with timolol 0.5%.
