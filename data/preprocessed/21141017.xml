   <abstracttext label="BACKGROUND" nlmcategory="BACKGROUND">
    trabeculectomy is the standard surgical procedure for management of glaucoma.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    to compare the outcome of triangular and rectangular scleral flaps in trabeculectomy.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    this study was carried out in the Department ofOphthalmology, BPKIHS, Dharan, over a period of one year. A total of 22
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    undergoing trabeculectomy were randomized to undergo either
    <a1>
     trabeculectomy
    </a1>
    with triangular scleral flap (Group A_CRI_eyes) or
    <a2>
     trabeculectomy
    </a2>
    with rectangular flap (Group B _CRI_eyes).

   <abstracttext label="OUTCOME MEASUREMENT" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    the parameters studied were intraocular

     pressure
    </oc>
    , anterior chamber depth , bleb characteristics and surgical complications.

   <abstracttext label="STATISTICS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    P value of_CRI_was considered significant. All calculations were executed using SPSS 11.0 software program.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    the age ranged between _POFT_ to _POFT_ with the mean of 56.5 +/ _POFT_. The most common preoperative diagnosis was angle closure glaucoma. The postoperative percentage of Intraocular Pressure reduction (Group A
    <r1>
     68.9%
    </r1>
    ; Group B
    <r2>
     66.51%
    </r2>
    ) was statically significant in both the groups _PVAL_. Trabeculectomy was almost equally effective with complete surgical success of 91% in group A, and 82% in group B _PVAL_. Final bleb scores were almost similar in both the groups with 3.27 +/ 1.5 in group A and 3.36 +/ 1.21 in group B _PVAL_. Hypotony with the Intraocular Pressure less than 6 mmHg was found in the first post operative day in 2 patients in Group A and in 1 in Group B. All of them improved spontaneously within a week.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    both triangular and rectangular scleral flaps in trabeculectomy are equally effective in terms of post surgical Intraocular Pressure control, bleb characteristics and complications.
