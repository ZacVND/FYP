   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the intraocular pressure lowering effect of combined
    <a1>
     viscocanalostomy
    </a1>
    and phacoemulsification and combined
    <a2>
     trabeculectomy
    </a2>
    and phacoemulsification with mitomycin C in eyes with primary open angle glaucoma.

   <abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Prospective randomized _POFT_ trial.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Forty consecutive
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    (40 eyes) with primary open angle glaucoma and cataract.

   <abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Eyes were assigned randomly either to trabeculectomy with mitomycin C or to viscocanalostomy in combination with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation.

    Success rate based on
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressure

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Mean baseline Intraocular Pressure was 24.0 +/ 2.0 mmHg in the viscocanalostomy group and 23.7 +/ 2.6 mmHg in the trabeculectomy group _PVAL_. Mean postoperative Intraocular Pressure was
    <r1>
     13.7 +/ 2.2 mmHg
    </r1>
    at _POFT_, _POFT_.8 +/ 3.3 mmHg at _POFT_, and _POFT_.9 +/ 3.0 mmHg at _POFT_ in the viscocanalostomy group and
    <r2>
     12.1 +/ 4.0 mmHg
    </r2>
    at _POFT_, _POFT_.8 +/ 4.7 mmHg at _POFT_, and _POFT_.1 +/ 4.4 mmHg at _POFT_ in the trabeculectomy group. There was no significant difference in the mean Intraocular Pressure between the groups at any time. At _POFT_, _POFT_ patients _MEAS_ in the viscocanalostomy group and 16 patients _MEAS_ in the trabeculectomy group achieved an Intraocular Pressure of 20 mmHg or less without medication _PVAL_. Complications included 2 cases _MEAS_ of flat/shallow anterior chamber and 4 cases _MEAS_ of hypotony in the trabeculectomy group, whereas intraoperative microperforation of Descemet's membrane occurred in 3 cases _MEAS_ in the viscocanalostomy group.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    There was no significant difference in Intraocular Pressure reduction between viscocanalostomy and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in combination with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation in patients with primary open angle glaucoma.
