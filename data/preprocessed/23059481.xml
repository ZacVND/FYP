   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the postoperative intraocular pressure and incidence of early complications after trabeculectomy with releasable suture to standard trabeculectomy in Chinese
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with primary angle closure glaucoma.

   <abstracttext label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    One hundred seventy five patients diagnosed as primary angle closure glaucoma with 6 clock _TIME_ or more of peripheral anterior synechia were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups: 87 underwent standard
    <a1>
     trabeculectomy
    </a1>
    (S group: 2 interrupted permanent sutures to the scleral flap) and 88 received
    <a2>
     trabeculectomy
    </a2>
    with 2 permanent and 2 releasable sutures (R group). The postoperative
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressure
    </oc>
    and complications during the first _POFT_ after surgery were compared.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    One hundred seventy one patients _MEAS_ attended the _POFT_ visit. The Intraocular Pressure in the first week after trabeculectomy was significantly higher in the R group: day 1,
    <r1>
     17.3 +/ 8.6
    </r1>
    versus
    <r2>
     12.7 +/ 6.0 mmHg
    </r2>
    _PVAL_; day 3, 18.0 +/ 7.3 versus 12.9 +/ 6.3 mmHg _PVAL_; day 7, 14.8 +/ 6.3 versus 12.0 +/ 4.9 mmHg _PVAL_, but no difference was observed after the second week (_PVAL_ to 0.753). The incidence of transient hypotony was higher in S group _MEAS_ than the R group _MEAS_ _PVAL_; hypotony recovered in 80.8% (_RATIO_6) within _POFT_. There was no difference in the occurrence of shallow chamber, choroidal detachment, macular edema, additional surgery, or hyphema (_PVAL_ to 1.0).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    The technique of releasable sutures for trabeculectomy used in this study did not demonstrate significant advantages over standard trabeculectomy. Releasable sutures were associated with some decrease in visual acuity and increase in postoperative complaints.
