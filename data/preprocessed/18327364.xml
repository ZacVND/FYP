    The study was designed as a _POFT_ randomized, observer masked study comprising 120 patients with primary open angle glaucoma in Feiz Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, from _YEAR_ to _YEAR_. The patients were randomized (latanoprost, _POP_; dorzolamide/timolol, _POP_) to treatment with either latanoprost, 0.005% once daily, or the combination of timolol 0.5% twice daily, and dorzolamide 2% 3 times daily. The mean intraocular

     pressure

    after one, 3, and _POFT_ of treatment was compared with baseline in the 2 groups.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    A total of 120 patients were randomized to 2 equal treatment groups. The mean baseline Intraocular Pressure values were similar between the 2 groups. The mean (standard error of mean ) Intraocular Pressure reductions at months one was

    (0.4), at _POFT_ was 7.3 (0.4), and at _POFT_ was 7.1 (0.3) mmHg for the latanoprost group and

    (0.3), 7.8 (0.3), and 7.4 (0.3) mmHg for the dorzolamide/timolol group. The 2 therapies were similarly effective.

    The latanoprost and dorzolamide/timolol combination were equally effective at lowering Intraocular Pressure compared to untreated baseline.
