    were included. Sixteen and 14 eyes of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma patients were randomized to receive 360Â° Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty or 0.004% travoprost, respectively. Fourteen and 16 eyes of Normal-Tension Glaucoma patients were randomized to receive either Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty or travoprost, respectively. The 24-hour Intraocular Pressure data were collected before treatment and 6 to 8 weeks after treatment. Intraocular Pressure was measured at 2 hours intervals in the sitting position during daytime (9 Alginate Once Daily to 7 PM) and in the supine position during nighttime (9 PM to 7 Alginate Once Daily). Main outcome measure was the

    of eyes that achieved posttreatment 24-hour Intraocular Pressure fluctuations &lt;3 mmHg. Success in fluctuation reduction was defined as at least a 50% reduction in these fluctuations.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Fifty-eight eyes were analyzed. Overall, eyes in the Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty and the travoprost groups achieved a significant reduction in Intraocular Pressure compared with the baseline Intraocular Pressure values (-3.7 mmHg [P = 0.002] versus -4.1 mmHg [P &lt; 0.001], respectively). There was no significant difference in Intraocular Pressure reduction in both groups according to type of glaucoma. During the diurnal period, 100% of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma eyes in the travoprost group achieved posttreatment Intraocular Pressure fluctuations &lt;3 mmHg, and 87% of eyes in the Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty group achieved the same level of fluctuations (P &lt; 0.001). Ninety-six percent of Normal-Tension Glaucoma eyes in the travoprost group, and 82% of eyes in the Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty group had Intraocular Pressure fluctuations &lt;3 mmHg (P = 0.01). Success in fluctuation reduction was

    and

    for the Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty and travoprost groups, respectively (P = 0.005). The effect of travoprost on Intraocular Pressure reduction in Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma and Normal-Tension Glaucoma patients was significant both during the daytime and the nighttime, while the Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty's effect was significant only during the nighttime.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Both travoprost and Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty can significantly reduce the Intraocular Pressure in patients with Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma and Normal-Tension Glaucoma. Based on habitual positions, travoprost better controls Intraocular Pressure fluctuations than Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty, especially during the daytime.
