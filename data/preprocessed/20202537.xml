    In this prospective double-masked randomized clinical trial, patients had phacoemulsification alone (control group) or phacoemulsification with iStent implantation (combined group). Primary outcomes were intraocular
    <oc>
     pressure
    </oc>
    and reduction in medication use over 15 months and Intraocular Pressure after a 1-month washout of ocular hypotensive agents (ie, 16 months postoperatively).
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    The baseline Intraocular Pressure was similar between groups (combined group: 17.9 mmHg +/- 2.6 ; control group: 17.3 +/- 3.0 mmHg) (P = .512). Three patients in the control group were lost to follow-up. The mean Intraocular Pressure was
    <r2>
     14.8 +/- 1.2 mmHg
    </r2>
    in the combined group and
    <r1>
     15.7 +/- 1.1 mmHg
    </r1>
    in the control group at 15 months and 16.6 +/- 3.1 mmHg and 19.2 +/- 3.5 mmHg, respectively, after washout; the Intraocular Pressure was statistically significantly lower in the combined group than in the control group at both time points (P = .031 and P = .042, respectively). At 15 months, the mean number of medications was lower in the combined group than in the control group (0.4 +/- 0.7 and 1.3 +/- 1.0, respectively; P = .007), as was the proportion of patients on ocular hypotensive medication (33% and 76%, respectively).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Phacoemulsification with stent implantation was more effective in controlling Intraocular Pressure than phacoemulsification alone; the safety profiles were similar.
