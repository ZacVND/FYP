   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the intraocular pressure  reducing effect and safety of
    <a1>
     latanoprost
    </a1>
    0.005% once daily with
    <a2>
     unoprostone
    </a2>
    0.12% twice daily in
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with primary open-angle glaucoma  or ocular hypertension .

   <abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    An 8-week, double-masked, randomized, parallel-group, single-center clinical trial.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    A total of 108 patients with Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension were enrolled.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="INTERVENTIONS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    After completing a wash-out of ocular hypotensive medications, patients were randomized to receive either latanoprost once daily in the evening plus placebo once daily in the morning, or unoprostone twice daily (morning and evening).
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressure
    </oc>
    was measured at 10:00 Alginate Once Daily and at 5:00 PM at baseline and at week 8, and before 12:00 noon at week 2. Ocular and systemic safety assessments were performed.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    From an overall baseline of 24.1 mmHg, latanoprost reduced Intraocular Pressure by
    <r1>
     6.7 mmHg
    </r1>
    (28%) and unoprostone reduced Intraocular Pressure by
    <r2>
     3.3 mmHg
    </r2>
    (14%). The difference between the groups of 3.4 mmHg was significant (P: &lt; 0.001, analysis of covariance; 95% confidence interval : -4.7 to -2.1) in favor of latanoprost. A &gt;/=30% reduction in mean Intraocular Pressure from baseline was achieved by 44% of latanoprost-treated patients compared with 8% of unoprostone-treated patients. The incidence of adverse events was low and comparable between the groups.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Latanoprost administered once daily was significantly more effective in reducing Intraocular Pressure compared with unoprostone administered twice daily in patients with Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension.
