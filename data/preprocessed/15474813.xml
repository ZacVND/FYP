    In this prospective randomized trial, 50 eyes of 50 patients with medically uncontrolled Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma were randomized to have a trabeculectomy (25 eyes) or a viscocanalostomy (25 eyes). Visual acuity, intraocular pressure , and slitlamp examinations were performed before surgery and 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    At 3 years, the mean
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressure
    </oc>
    was
    <r2>
     16.0 +/- 7.07 mmHg
    </r2>
    in the trabeculectomy group and
    <r1>
     17.8 +/- 4.6 mmHg
    </r1>
    in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.694). Complete success (Intraocular Pressure 6 to 21 mmHg without medication) was achieved in 66.2% of eyes at 6 months and 55.1% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 52.9% and 35.3%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy group (P&gt;.05). Qualified success (Intraocular Pressure 6 to 21 mmHg with medication) was achieved in 95.8% of eyes at 6 months and 79.2% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 90.7% and 73.9%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy group (P&gt;.05). Postoperative hypotony and cataract formation occurred more frequently in the trabeculectomy group than in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.002).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Primary trabeculectomy lowered Intraocular Pressure more than viscocanalostomy in Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma patients. However, the complication rate was lower in the viscocanalostomy group.
