    Brimonidin tartrate is a highly selective alpha 2 agonist. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of 0.2% brimonidine administered twice daily for _POFT_ in
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    The study design was a multicenter, double masked, randomized, parallel group, active controlled comparison clinical trial. Subjects instilled 0.2%
    <a1>
     brimonidine
    </a1>
    or 0.5%
    <a2>
     timolol
    </a2>
    maleate twice daily for _POFT_. Subjects were examined at baseline, _POFT_, and _POFT_, _POFT_, _POFT_, 6, 9, and 12. A subset of subjects was examined at _POFT_.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Of 443 subjects enrolled in this study, 374 met the entry criteria; 186 received brimonidine and 188 received timolol. Brimonidine treated subjects showed an overall mean peak
    <oc>
     reduction
    </oc>
    in intraocular pressure of
    <r1>
     6.5 mmHg
    </r1>
    ; timolol treated subjects had a mean peak reduction in Intraocular Pressure of
    <r2>
     6.1 mmHg
    </r2>
    . Brimonidine lowered mean peak Intraocular Pressure significantly more than timolol at _POFT_ and _POFT_ _PVAL_; no significant difference was observed between the groups for this variable at other visits throughout the _POFT_ course of the study. No evidence of tachyphylaxis was seen in either group. Allergy was seen in 9% of subjects treated with brimonidine. Dry mouth was more common in the brimonidine treated group than in the timolol treated group (33.0% versus 19.4%), but complaints of burning and stinging were more common in the timolol treated group _MEAS_ than in the brimonidine treated patients _MEAS_. Headache, fatigue, and drowsiness were similar in the 2 groups. In general, the tolerance to medication was acceptable.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Brimonidine is safe and effective in lowering Intraocular Pressure in glaucomatous eyes. Brimonidine provides a sustained long term ocular hypotensive effect, is well tolerated, and has a low rate of allergic response.
