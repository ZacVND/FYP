   <abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To assess the safety and efficacy of the iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent (Glaukos Corporation, Laguna Hills, CA) in combination with cataract surgery in subjects with mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma.

   <abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter clinical trial.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    A total of 240
    <p>
     eyes
    </p>
    with mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma with intraocular pressure  =24 mmHg controlled on 1 to 3 medications were randomized to undergo cataract surgery with iStent
    <a1>
     implantation
    </a1>
    (treatment group) or cataract
    <a2>
     surgery
    </a2>
    only (control). Fifty additional subjects were enrolled to undergo cataract surgery with iStent implantation under protocol expansion. Data in this report are based on the first 240 eyes enrolled.

   <abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Implantation of the iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent in conjunction with cataract surgery or cataract surgery only.

   <abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    The primary efficacy measure was unmedicated
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressure
    </oc>
    ≤21 mmHg at 1 year. A secondary measure was unmedicated Intraocular Pressure reduction ≥20% at 1 year. Safety measures included best-corrected visual acuity , slit-lamp observations, complications, and adverse events.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    The study met the primary outcome, with
    <r1>
     72%
    </r1>
    of treatment eyes versus
    <r2>
     50%
    </r2>
    of control eyes achieving the criterion (P&lt;0.001). At 1 year, Intraocular Pressure in both treatment groups was statistically significantly lower from baseline values. Sixty-six percent of treatment eyes versus 48% of control eyes achieved =20% Intraocular Pressure reduction without medication (P = 0.003). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar between groups with no unanticipated adverse device effects.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Pressure reduction on fewer medications was clinically and statistically significantly better 1 year after stent plus cataract surgery versus cataract surgery alone, with an overall safety profile similar to that of cataract surgery alone.
