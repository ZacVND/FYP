   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Two _POFT_, parallel group, randomized, observer masked and patient masked, multicentre, clinical trials were performed in
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma. Study 1 (_POP_) was conducted in the United States and Study 2 (_POP_) was conducted in Europe/Israel. Patients could be included whether or not they were currently taking ocular hypotensive therapy, and regardless of the effectiveness of any previous therapy. Patients were washed out from their usual ocular hypotensive medications and then those with a baseline intraocular pressure &gt;/_CRI_ were randomized to either the dorzolamide/timolol combination eye drops twice daily or latanoprost eye drops once daily in both eyes. Efficacy was assessed by daytime diurnal

    (the mean of measurements made at 0800, _YEAR_, 1400 and 1600 h).

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    At baseline, the mean daytime diurnal Intraocular Pressure was 26.1 mmHg in the dorzolamide/timolol combination group versus 25.6 mmHg in the latanoprost group in Study 1, and 25.3 mmHg in the dorzolamide/timolol combination group versus 24.7 mmHg in the latanoprost group in Study 2. After _POFT_, the mean daytime diurnal Intraocular Pressure was
    <r1>
     18.9 mmHg
    </r1>
    for the dorzolamide/timolol combination versus
    <r2>
     18.4 mmHg
    </r2>
    for latanoprost in Study 1, and 17.4 mmHg for the dorzolamide/timolol combination versus 17.5 for latanoprost in Study 2. The difference between treatments in mean Intraocular Pressure change at _POFT_ was 0.04 mmHg [95% confidence interval 0.85, 0.77] in Study 1, and 0.57 mmHg (95% Confidence Interval 1.31, 0.16) in Study 2. The probability that the true difference lay between 1.5 and 1.5 mmHg, the predefined bounds for equivalence, was _CRI_in both studies. Both treatments were well tolerated over _POFT_, although ocular stinging occurred more frequently with the dorzolamide/timolol combination.

    The dorzolamide/timolol combination and latanoprost were equally effective at lowering Intraocular Pressure.
