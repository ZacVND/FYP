   <abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Prospective, randomized, double-masked, 12-week, multicenter study.
   </abstracttext>
   <abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Individuals aged &lt;18 years with glaucoma.

   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    Stratified by age, diagnosis, and intraocular pressure  level, subjects were randomized (1:1) to latanoprost vehicle at 8 am and latanoprost 0.005% at 8 pm or timolol 0.5% (0.25% for those aged &lt;3 years) twice daily (8 am, 8 pm). At baseline and weeks 1, 4, and 12, Intraocular Pressure and ocular safety were assessed and adverse events were recorded. Therapy was switched to open-label latanoprost pm and timolol am and pm for uncontrolled Intraocular Pressure.

    from baseline to week 12. Latanoprost was considered noninferior to timolol if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval  of the difference was &gt;-3 mmHg. A proportion of responders (subjects with â‰¥15% Intraocular Pressure reduction at weeks 4 and 12) were evaluated. Analyses were performed in diagnosis subgroups: primary congenital glaucoma  and non-Primary Congenital Glaucoma.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    In total, 137 subjects were treated (safety population; 12-18 years, n=48; 3-&lt;12 years, n=55; 0-&lt;3 years, n=34). Mean age was 8.8Â +/- 5.5 years, and mean baseline Intraocular Pressure was 27.7Â +/- 6.17 mmHg; 125 subjects completed the study, and 107 subjects were in the per protocol population. Mean Intraocular Pressure reductions for latanoprost and timolol at week 12 were

    and
    <r2>
     5.7 mmHg
    </r2>
    , respectively, with a difference of 1.5 mmHg (95% Confidence Interval, -0.8 to 3.7; P=0.21). Responder rates were 60% for latanoprost and 52% for timolol (P=0.33). Between-treatment differences in mean Intraocular Pressure reduction for Primary Congenital Glaucoma and non-Primary Congenital Glaucoma subgroups were 0.6 mmHg (95% Confidence Interval, -2.3 to 3.4) and 2.6 mmHg (95% Confidence Interval, -0.8 to 6.1), respectively. Responder rates for latanoprost versus timolol were 50% versus 46% for the Primary Congenital Glaucoma group and 72% versus 57% for the non-Primary Congenital Glaucoma group. Both therapies were well tolerated.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Latanoprost 0.005% is not inferior (i.e., is either more or similarly effective) to timolol and produces clinically relevant Intraocular Pressure reductions across pediatric patients with and without Primary Congenital Glaucoma. Both latanoprost and timolol had favorable safety profiles over the duration of this 3-month trial.
