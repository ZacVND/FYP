   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the intraocular pressure lowering effect of
    <a1>
     latanoprost
    </a1>
    with that of
    <a2>
     dorzolamide
    </a2>
    when added to timolol.

   <abstracttext label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    This randomized, open label study with two parallel groups was conducted in five centers in Greece. The study enrolled 148
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with inadequately controlled open angle or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (intraocular pressure of at least 22 mmHg) or ocular hypertension (intraocular pressure of at least 27 mmHg) who were receiving monotherapy with a beta blocker or dual therapy in which one of the agents was a beta blocker. The patients were switched to timolol 0.5% twice daily for _POFT_ to _POFT_ (run in period) before the start of the study (baseline). At baseline, the patients were randomized to receive latanoprost 0.005% once daily or dorzolamide 2% twice daily as add on therapy to timolol. The intraocular
    <oc>
     pressure
    </oc>
    was recorded at _TIME_ Alginate Once Daily, _TIME_, and _TIME_ at baseline and at _POFT_. Safety was followed throughout the study.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    The diurnal intraocular pressure reduction was significant in both groups _PVAL_. The mean intraocular pressure reduction from baseline was
    <r1>
     32%
    </r1>
    for the latanoprost plus timolol group and
    <r2>
     20%
    </r2>
    for the dorzolamide plus timolol group. The least square estimate of the mean diurnal intraocular pressure reduction after _POFT_ was 7.06 mmHg in the latanoprost plus timolol group and 4.44 mmHg in the dorzolamide plus timolol group _PVAL_. Drugs administered in both treatment groups were well tolerated.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    This study clearly showed that the additive diurnal intraocular pressure lowering effect of latanoprost is superior to that of dorzolamide in patients treated with timolol.
