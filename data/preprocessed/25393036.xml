   Phacoemulsification Versus Combined Phacoemulsification and Viscogonioplasty in Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
  </title>
  <abstract>
   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the effect of
    <a1>
     phacoemulsification
    </a1>
    (Phaco) versus combined
    <a2>
     phacoemulsification
    </a2>
    and viscogonioplasty (Phaco-VGP) on long-term intraocular pressure  in primary angle-closure glaucoma .

   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    In this prospective randomized clinical trial, 92 eyes of 82
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma and coexisting cataract were randomized to undergo Phaco alone (46 eyes) or Phaco-VGP (45 eyes) and completed the trial. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography was performed preoperatively and at 1 year after surgery. Main outcome measures were
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressure
    </oc>
    and the number of Intraocular Pressure-lowering medications.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Phaco alone reduced the mean Intraocular Pressure from a preoperative level of 22.3 +/- 6.3 to
    <r1>
     14.0 +/- 3.7 mmHg
    </r1>
    at 12 months after surgery (P&lt;0.001). Phaco-VGP reduced the mean Intraocular Pressure from a preoperative level of 23.3 +/- 7.3 to
    <r2>
     14.5 +/- 2.5 mmHg
    </r2>
    (P&lt;0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in Intraocular Pressure and number of medications at all follow-up times. Trabecular-iris space-area measured by anterior segment optical coherence tomography increased significantly after Phaco alone and Phaco-VGP. The amount of the increase was higher in the Phaco-VGP. Although peripheral anterior synechiae  extent decreased significantly by Phaco alone, Phaco-VGP resulted in significantly greater reduction in Peripheral Anterior Synechiae extent (P=0.004). The only variables that predicted change in Intraocular Pressure in the whole group were preoperative Intraocular Pressure (β=-0.891, P&lt;0.001) and female sex (β=2.754, P=0.02).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Phaco alone and Phaco-VGP resulted in widening of the drainage angle, reduction of Intraocular Pressure, and Peripheral Anterior Synechiae extent in Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma eyes. Phaco-VGP resulted in significantly more reduction of Peripheral Anterior Synechiae and more opening of angle. However, it seems that additional VGP has no significant effect on long-term Intraocular Pressure.
