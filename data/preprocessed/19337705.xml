   <abstracttext label="INTRODUCTION" nlmcategory="BACKGROUND">
    The purpose of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of the Ex PRESS (Optonol Ltd., Neve Ilan, Israel) mini glaucoma shunt in open angle glaucoma.

   <abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">
    This was a prospective, randomized trial. Eyes from enrolled patients were randomly assigned to either Ex PRESS
    <a1>
     implantation
    </a1>
    under a scleral flap, or
    <a2>
     trabeculectomy
    </a2>
    . The main outcome measures were: mean intraocular pressure , postoperative medication use, visual acuity, and incidence of complications. Complete success was defined as an
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressure
    </oc>
    of _CRI_ and _CRI_ without the use of antiglaucoma medications. A more stringent target of Intraocular Pressure _CRI_ and _CRI_ was also noted.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    There were 78
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    (80 eyes) with primary open angle, pseudoexfoliative, or pigmentary glaucoma enrolled in the study. A total of
    <r1>
     84.6%
    </r1>
    of patients receiving Ex PRESS and
    <r2>
     60.0%
    </r2>
    of patients receiving trabeculectomy _PVAL_ achieved complete success. The respective proportions of patients achieving an Intraocular Pressure _CRI_ and _CRI_ were 76.9% and 50.0% _PVAL_. At _POFT_ follow up, complete success rates were 81.8% for Ex PRESS and 47.5% for trabeculectomy _PVAL_, and 71.7% and 37.5% _PVAL_, respectively, for the more stringent target. There was a similar level of postoperative interventions and complications for each group.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    In open angle glaucoma, the Ex PRESS mini glaucoma shunt implanted under a superficial scleral flap produces significantly higher success rates, and a similar complication rate, compared with trabeculectomy. The Ex PRESS is a safe and effective device for treating open angle glaucoma.
