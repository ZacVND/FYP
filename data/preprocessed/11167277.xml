   <abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">
    To compare the effect on intraocular pressure of
    <a1>
     latanoprost
    </a1>
    versus
    <a2>
     timolol
    </a2>
    plus dorzolamide in open angle glaucoma.

    Thirty five
    <p>
     patients
    </p>
    with open angle glaucoma were randomized, 18 to latanoprost once daily and 17 to timolol plus dorzolamide twice daily. Intraocular
    <oc>
     pressure
    </oc>
    and ocular side effects were recorded at baseline, and after _POFT_ and _POFT_ of treatment.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Latanoprost reduced the intraocular pressure 1.09 and 1.58 mmHg more than timolol plus dorzolamide after _POFT_ and _POFT_ of treatment, respectively. These differences were statistically significant _PVAL_ at the end of the study. After _POFT_ of treatment,
    <r1>
     32.3%
    </r1>
    of the eyes in the latanoprost group reduced the intraocular pressure in 30% or more with respect to baseline, while
    <r2>
     15.6%
    </r2>
    of the eyes in the timolol plus dorzolamide group achieved this reduction.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Latanoprost administered once daily reduced the intraocular pressure at least as well as timolol plus dorzolamide twice daily in patients with open angle glaucoma.
