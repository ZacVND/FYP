    To compare the effect on intraocular pressure  of the silicone Ahmed glaucoma
    <a1>
     valve

    with and without an intravitreal injection of

    with clinically uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma were included in the study; 22 were randomly assigned to the study group (silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve implant with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide) and 27 to the control group (silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve).
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressure
    </oc>
    was the primary outcome measure in this study. The secondary outcome measure was success, defined by Intraocular Pressure lower than 22 mmHg and higher than 5 mmHg, and no serious complications. Success rates in both the groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test. Intraocular Pressure levels were compared using mixed linear model analysis to correct for repeated measures correlation.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Forty-three patients, 18 in the study group and 25 in the control group, completed the study (follow-up of 12 mo). The mean Intraocular Pressure was significantly lower after 1 year in both the groups (P&lt;0.001). The mean Intraocular Pressure in the first month of follow-up was lower in the study group (control;
    <r2>
     20.4 +/- 9.7
    </r2>
    , study;
    <r1>
     13.6 +/- 6.5
    </r1>
    , P&lt;0.01). The success rate at 1 year was 78% for the study group and 76% for the control group (P=0.82). Complication rates were not different between the groups.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide in neovascular glaucoma did not affect the intermediate-term success of the silicone Ahmed valve nor reduce the incidence of complications. The mean Intraocular Pressure spike in the first month was lower in the triamcinolone group.
