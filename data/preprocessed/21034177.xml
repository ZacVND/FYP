    To compare the efficacy of

     bimatoprost

    <p>
     Patients
    </p>
    with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either bimatoprost 0.03% or travoprost 0.004% once daily.
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressures
    </oc>
    were measured at baseline; 2 weeks; and 1, 2, 4, and 6 months using Goldman applanation tonometery.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Seventy-two patients were included: 34 and 38 (P=0.142) with a baseline mean Intraocular Pressure 26.52 +/- 5.185 and 26.36 +/- 1.605 mmHg (P=0.629) for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively. Both drops provided statistically significant Intraocular Pressure reductions from baseline at all visits (P&lt;0.001). Bimatoprost provided greater (nonsignificant) mean Intraocular Pressure reductions from baseline than travoprost at each visit. Mean Intraocular Pressure reductions was
    <r1>
     8.77 mmHg
    </r1>
    (33.39%) and
    <r2>
     8.42 mmHg
    </r2>
    (31.54%) at 2 weeks (P = 0.703), and 8.47 mmHg (31.61%) and 7.84 mmHg (29.50%) at 6 months (P = 0.536) for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively. Intraocular Pressures at 2 weeks were 18 mmHg in 20 (58.8%) versus 19 (50%) eyes (P = 0.603), and 16 mmHg in 12 (35%) versus 12 (32%) eyes (P = 0.456); and at 6 months 18 mmHg in 22 (65%) versus 14 (37%) eyes (P = 0.045), and 16 mmHg in 12 (35%) versus 7 (18%) eyes (P = 0.037) for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively. Ocular adverse and clinical success occurred equally with both drops.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Both drops lowered Intraocular Pressure effectively but bimatoprost showed a greater non-significant reductions in mean Intraocular Pressure from baseline.
