    To compare the efficacy of
    <a1>
     bimatoprost
    </a1>
    and
    <a2>
     travoprost
    </a2>
    on intraocular pressure reduction in an Egyptian population.

    <p>
     Patients
    </p>
    with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either bimatoprost 0.03% or travoprost 0.004% once daily.
    <oc>
     Intraocular Pressures
    </oc>
    were measured at baseline; _POFT_; and 1, 2, 4, and _POFT_ using Goldman applanation tonometery.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    Seventy two patients were included: 34 and 38 _PVAL_ with a baseline mean Intraocular Pressure 26.52 +/ 5.185 and 26.36 +/ 1.605 mmHg _PVAL_ for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively. Both drops provided statistically significant Intraocular Pressure reductions from baseline at all visits _PVAL_. Bimatoprost provided greater (nonsignificant) mean Intraocular Pressure reductions from baseline than travoprost at each visit. Mean Intraocular Pressure reductions was
    <r1>
     8.77 mmHg
    </r1>
    _MEAS_ and
    <r2>
     8.42 mmHg
    </r2>
    _MEAS_ at _POFT_ _PVAL_, and 8.47 mmHg _MEAS_ and 7.84 mmHg _MEAS_ at _POFT_ _PVAL_ for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively. Intraocular Pressures at _POFT_ were 18 mmHg in 20 _MEAS_ versus 19 _MEAS_ eyes _PVAL_, and 16 mmHg in 12 _MEAS_ versus 12 _MEAS_ eyes _PVAL_; and at _POFT_ 18 mmHg in 22 _MEAS_ versus 14 _MEAS_ eyes _PVAL_, and 16 mmHg in 12 _MEAS_ versus 7 _MEAS_ eyes _PVAL_ for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively. Ocular adverse and clinical success occurred equally with both drops.

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    Both drops lowered Intraocular Pressure effectively but bimatoprost showed a greater non significant reductions in mean Intraocular Pressure from baseline.
