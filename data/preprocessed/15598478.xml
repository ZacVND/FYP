    Approximately 40% of patients with glaucoma are concomitantly prescribed _CRI_different intraocular pressure lowering medications. An effective and well tolerated fixed combination of agents requiring once daily instillation may improve patient compliance.

    This _POFT_, randomized, double masked, active control study was conducted at 49 study sites in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, the United States, and Venezuela.

    with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who had failed to reach an Intraocular Pressure of _CRI_ while receiving latanoprost for at least _POFT_ were enrolled. After an additional _POFT_ of latanoprost run in, patients were randomly assigned to continue latanoprost monotherapy or to switch to the fixed combination for _POFT_. The intent to treat population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of double masked study medication; the per protocol analysis included patients who completed the study without a major protocol violation and who had Intraocular Pressure measurements both at baseline and at day 21. The primary end point was the

    of patients whose Intraocular Pressure was decreased _CRI_ from the baseline level on day 21. Proportions of patients demonstrating Intraocular Pressure decreases _CRI_, _CRI_, or _CRI_ from the baseline level and of patients reaching an 10P _CRI_ were evaluated. Adverse events (Adverse Effects) were also assessed.

   <abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">
    A total of 350 patients were enrolled. In all, 348 patients were included in the Intent To Treat and tolerability analyses (fixed combination, _POP_; latanoprost, _POP_; mean age, 64.4 [13.2] and 63.2 [14.0] years, respectively; 103 women in each group). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between groups. A higher percentage of patients receiving the fixed combination had Intraocular Pressure decreases of 2 mmHg on day 21 relative to baseline compared with latanoprost treated patients (

     79.4%
    </r1>
    versus
    <r2>
     51.4%
    </r2>
    , respectively; _PVAL_). Per Protocol analyses found that more patients in the fixed combination group had Intraocular Pressure decreases _CRI_, _CRI_, or _CRI_ (for each target level, _PVAL_ versus latanoprost group) or final Intraocular Pressure 18 mmHg (fixed combination, 35.1%; latanoprost, 17.8%; _PVAL_). Both treatments were well tolerated. Similar proportions of patients in the fixed combination and latanoprost groups reported at least 1 treatment emergent Adverse Effect (10.9% and 12.1%, respectively).

   <abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">
    In this selected population of patients with an inadequate initial Intraocular Pressure response to latanoprost, switching to fixed combination latanoprosttimolol resulted in a greater decrease in Intraocular Pressure and similar tolerability compared with continuing latanoprost therapy.
