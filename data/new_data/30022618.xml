<title>Primary Baerveldt versus trabeculectomy study after one-year follow-up.</title>
<abstract>
<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare a <a1>Baerveldt implant</a1> and <a2>trabeculectomy</a2> with respect to intraocular pressure (IOP) and failure rate at 1 year of follow-up. Secondary outcomes are pharmacological therapy and complications at 1 year of follow-up.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This was a randomized, comparative study. A total of 119 glaucoma <p>patients</p> without previous ocular surgery were included at the Rotterdam Eye Hospital, the Netherlands. One eye of each subject was randomized to either a Baerveldt glaucoma drainage device (BGI) or trabeculectomy (TE). Follow-up visits were conducted at 1 day, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">After one year, the final <oc>IOP</oc> was equivalent for both treatment groups: <r1>14 ± 4 mmHg</r1> (mean ± SD) for the Baerveldt group versus <r2>13 ± 4 mmHg</r2> for the trabeculectomy group. Statistically, we found no significant difference in failure rate between the two groups. However, the Baerveldt group needed significantly more medication to decrease IOP. Overall, self-limiting complication rate was similar in both groups. Diplopia, a serious complication, was significantly more present in the BGI group.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">One year after surgery, TE shows better results than the BGI. The final IOP, IOP reduction and failure rate are similar, but the need for additional IOP lowering medication in the BGI group is higher as well as the complication rate. The increased risk of developing diplopia after placement of a BGI must be taken into consideration.</abstracttext>
