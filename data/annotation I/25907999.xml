<abstract>
<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To confirm the non-inferiority of the IOP-lowering effect of the 0.0015% <a1>Tafluprost</a1> ophthalmic solution to the 0.005% <a2>Latanoprost</a2> ophthalmic solution in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Safety was also compared between two groups.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This study was conducted from August 2008 to December 2009, at five clinical trial sites in China. Patients of this study <p>population</p> was diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in both eyes. Subjects were randomized into 0.0015% Tafluprost group or 0.005% Latanoprost group. Intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> (IOP) measurement by Goldmann applanation tonometer, slit-lamp microscopy, Gonioscopy, Fundascopy, Visual acuity test, Perimetry, Blood pressure and pulse rate, Subjective symptoms were compered between two groups at Week 0, Week 2 and Week 4. For main effectiveness evaluation index adopt the bad effect evaluation, safety evaluation index by Fisher's exact test probability method.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The 246 subjects/246 eyes were randomized (Tafluprost group:122 subjects/122 eyes, Latanoprost group:124 subjects/ 124 eyes). Change in the IOP at 17:00 of Week 2 is (8.8 ± 3.8) mmHg and (8.9 ± 4.4) mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) in Tafluprost group and Latanoprost group. Percent change in the IOP at 17:00 of Week 2 is (33.2 ± 12.8)% and (34.4 ± 14.1)% in Tafluprost group and Latanoprost group. Change in the IOP at 17:00 at the end of treatment is <r1>(9.8 ± 4.0) mmHg</r1> and <r2>(9.2 ± 4.1) mmHg</r2> in Tafluprost group and Latanoprost group. Percent change in the IOP at 17:00 at the end of treatment is 37.2% ± 13.4% group and 35.7% ± 13.0% in Tafluprost and Latanoprost group. In addition, distribution of subjects with percentage decrease of IOP &amp;gt; 30% was 72.5% in Tafluprost group higher than 63.8% in Latanoprost group. The major adverse reactions were conjunctival hyperemia, eye irritation, eye pain and foreign body sensation. The incidence of adverse reactions is 31.7% in Tafluprost group and 20.8% in Latanoprost group. The inter-group difference had no statistical significance.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Efficacy and safety of Tafluprost ophthalmic solution are no less than Latanoprost ophthalmic solution in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</abstracttext>
